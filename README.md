# Pathfinder-vue
## A Vue implementation of https://github.com/orionriitters/path_finder.
This web application queries the APIs of https://www.hikingproject.com/ and http://nominatim.org/. Users can search for cities in the US, view a leaflet map populated with various trails, save the trails to a backend, and view details of each trail. This application uses Express for routing and Postgres for data persistence.

Setup instructinos to come.
